.SH NAME
pass clip - A \fBpass\fP(1) extension that lets you quickly copy to
clipboard passwords using \fBfzf\fP(1) or \fBrofi\fP(1).

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpass clip\fP [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpass clip\fP  Provide an interactive solution to copy passwords to
the clipboard. It will show all pass-names in either fzf or rofi, waits
for the user to select one then copy it to the clipboard.  The user can
select fzf or rofi by giving either \fI--fzf\fP or \fI--rofi\fP.  By
default, rofi will be selected and pass-clip will fallback to fzf. If
the selected password does not exist, a new one will be generated
automatically then copied to the clipboard. Specific password length can
be given using \fI--length\fP and no symbols can be activate with
\fI--no-symbols\fP. Note the latter two options must be given on the
command line, one cannot specify them through fzf or rofi.
